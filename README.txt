This is a bootstrapped CoffeeScript project with
node, especially made for Windows.

This project is in very early stages!

It requires only Ruby to run on Windows, as it bundles
node and CoffeeScript.

Usage:
  ruby autotest.rb

Modify autotest-actions.rb to decide what to do when a file is modified, added or deleted.
